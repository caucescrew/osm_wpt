# Add OSM waypoints on gpx
This script aims at automatically adding waypoints (WPT) on a GPX route. These waypoints are particularly useful when you follow a route on your GPS to know or remind you the points you pass. It can be for example, the name of a mountain pass, the name of a peak or the position of a source of drinking water, etc.

Here is a standard gpx file cointaining only the route to follow:

After processing, new waypoints are automatically added on the route.

### Prerequisites

[**gpxpy**](https://github.com/tkrajina/gpxpy) 
```bash
pip install gpxpy
```
[**overpass**](https://github.com/mvexel/overpass-api-python-wrapper)
```bash
pip install overpass
```

### Usage


Import gpx:

The outputed gpx can be imported on [**movescount**](http://www.movescount.com/map) for Suunto users. Unfortunately the waypoint type is not recognized by movescount. 

For Garmin users and in particular with the FÄ“nix 3 watch, the gpx file can be transfered on the directory: **Garmin/NewFiles/**. For others watches or more details on the file transfert, I recommand to read [**this**](http://www.scarletfire.co.uk/transfer-gpx-file-to-garmin/).
